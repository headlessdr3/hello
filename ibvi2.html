        The Brethren of the Void was created created for the opportunity to be a part of something different. There is no true leader in this squadron, as democracy is the path chosen. Members have a direct say, by vote, as to the direction the faction heads. We are a group of veterans, casual, die-hard and new players from around the world. <br>
        We believe the key to success of a player minor faction is placing members in roles that they enjoy the most. If you're preferred play is bounty hunting then that's what we want you to do. Xeno defence your thing? We want you to, not only succeed in that, but have fun while doing it. Prefer to find lucrative trade routes or explore the blackness of space? We'll help with that as well. The point is that we want our members to have fun while they support the faction.
        What to expect when you submit an application for enrollment:
        You'll be contacted by an administrator to set up an interview. This is where they will want to chat and see what your expectations are and you'll learn more of ours. You'll get a feel of how we operate and can decide if the Brethren of the Void is right for you.
